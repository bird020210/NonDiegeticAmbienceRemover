some sounds may not be removed due to a mistake on my part. i followed a video with the sanity sounds and through testing some of the names weren't accurate to the actual file name counterpart. i did not test all the sounds, but i did (hopefully) fix the ones that were wrong

## issues
incase of issues with the sounds not being replaced or the replaced sound not working, please follow this link to my GitHub repository issues page: https://github.com/bird020210/NonDiegeticAmbienceRemover/issues

## notes
please note that this is my first time uploading a mod to thunderstore, so i hope that this didn't fail terribly lol
