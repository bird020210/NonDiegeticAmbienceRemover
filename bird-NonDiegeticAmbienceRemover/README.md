some sounds may not be removed due to a mistake on my part. i followed a video with the sanity sounds and through testing some of the names weren't accurate to the actual file name counterpart. i did not test all the sounds, but i did (hopefully) fix the ones that were wrong

## issues
incase of issues with the sounds not being replaced or the replaced sound not working, please follow this link to my GitHub repository issues page: https://github.com/bird020210/NonDiegeticAmbienceRemover/issues

please make sure you include the exact sound name as it is written. to find the name of the sound you want, press f5 while in game. this will enable LCSoundTool to start logging the sounds that are currently playing. if f5 does not work, go to the LCSoundTool page, it will tell you how to fix it.

## notes
please note that this is my first time uploading a mod to thunderstore, so i hope that this didn't fail terribly lol
